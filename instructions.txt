Everyday when you start a new study session you need to create a new branch based on the main branch of this repo, example
you are on main branch, so from here you need to create a branch with this structure:
    main-date-user
    main-10/09/2022-JJRR5
    (use your user name from github)
always that you start a new day you need to create a new branch where you are going to upload your changes.
Everyday you need tu create a pull request with your changes.
